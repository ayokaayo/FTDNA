# Regression Report — Prototype & Page Builder System

> Full regression audit of instruction files, build engine, component references, and live Figma validation.
> Conducted: 2026-03-25
> Tested against: 🧬 FT DNA (`7J3dSTuOSRlsHBqQ4ohtxI`)

---

## Executive Summary

| Severity | Count |
|----------|-------|
| CRITICAL (bugs causing incorrect output) | 3 |
| HIGH (documentation errors that mislead builds) | 4 |
| MEDIUM (missing recipes / gaps) | 4 |
| LOW (documentation staleness) | 3 |

**Overall:** The core build engine is solid — 22/22 component IDs valid, 33/33 variables valid, 30/30 row variants correct, Base Template structure intact. The problems are in **three areas**: (1) one confirmed code bug in `setShell()`, (2) two deleted Figma nodes that will crash builds, and (3) scattered documentation contradictions that create ambiguity.

## T1: Reference Integrity

| Check | Result | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| SKILL.md → component-ids.md | PASS | File exists at expected path |
| SKILL.md → code-patterns.md | PASS | File exists at expected path |
| SKILL.md → page-patterns.md | PASS | File exists at expected path |
| SKILL.md → component-catalog.md | PASS | File exists at expected path |
| SKILL.md → base-template.md | PASS | File exists at expected path |
| SKILL.md → ft-dna-variables.json | PASS | File exists at expected path |
| SKILL.md → briefs/_TEMPLATE.md | PASS | File exists with full template structure |
| CLAUDE.md → `references/design-system.md` | **FAIL** | **File does not exist.** CLAUDE.md status table says "design-system.md refreshed from Figma variables" — phantom reference. |
| CLAUDE.md → Seed instance `3:5535` | **FAIL** | **Node deleted from Figma.** Key Decisions table references this as "NEVER delete — source for all prototype clones" but it's gone. |
| code-patterns.md → QA template `180:69323` | **FAIL** | **Node deleted from Figma.** LIST-NESTED (Email Templates) clone source no longer exists. |
| page-patterns.md → `Search#4635:14` | **FAIL** | **Property does not exist** on Standard Panel. Panel only has `Panel header#4117:35` (INSTANCE_SWAP) and `Side - Width` (VARIANT). |
| composition-tracker.md pattern coverage table | WARN | Lists `addToolbar` and `clonePanel` as "No — not in code-patterns.md" but both helpers exist. Stale data. |
| component-ids.md → Tag Leading Icon default | **FAIL** | Two contradicting values in the same file (see T2). |

---

## T2: Instruction Consistency

### FAIL: Tag `Leading Icon#26:0` default contradicts itself

**component-ids.md line ~128** (Tag Component Properties section):
```
Leading Icon#26:0 | BOOLEAN | false | Icon before text
```

**component-ids.md line ~336** (Component Property Registry section):
```
Leading Icon#26:0 | BOOL | true | Icon before text
```

**Live Figma value:** `true`

The first section is wrong. A builder reading the Tag Component Properties section would set `Leading Icon` to `false` to "reset to default" — but this actually changes it from the real default of `true`.

### FAIL: page-patterns.md references non-existent Search property

**page-patterns.md** Pattern 2a (LIST-SIMPLE), Pattern 2c (LIST-FULL):
> Search: Built into Panel Header — `Search#4635:14: true`

**Live Figma:** Standard Panel has NO `Search#4635:14` property. Its only properties are:
- `Panel header#4117:35` (INSTANCE_SWAP → `92:46641`)
- `Side - Width` (VARIANT → "Full")

The actual search mechanism is a **manual visibility toggle** on the `Search + Action Icons` frame inside the detached Panel Header, as correctly implemented in `setShell()`. The page-patterns.md reference is stale and misleading.

### FAIL: ZEBRA_GRAY hardcodes RGB (violates R10)

**code-patterns.md** Rules Reference R10:
> All fills/strokes = **variable-bound** (bindFill/bindStroke, never hardcode RGB)

**code-patterns.md** Status Tag Cell pattern:
```javascript
const ZEBRA_GRAY = {type:'SOLID',color:{r:0.9804,g:0.9804,b:0.9804}};
```

This hardcodes the mono-100 RGB value instead of using `bindFill(wrapper, V.mono100)`. The visual result is identical (`#FAFAFA`), but the fill is NOT variable-bound — it won't respond to theme switching and violates the system's own rule.

**Fix:** Replace the hardcoded solid fill with `await bindFill(wrapper, V.mono100)` for ODD rows.

### WARN: "Always Base Template" vs "Clone Quick Access"

**SKILL.md** Critical Rule 1:
> Always Base Template — instantiate `94:21370`, never build from scratch

**code-patterns.md** Gate 0:
> Quick Access has a clonable template? → YES: CLONE IT. Do not rebuild from scratch.

These are not contradictory (QA templates are themselves based on the Base Template), but the ambiguity is that **all code recipes use `bootstrapScreen()`** (which instantiates the Base Template) while Gate 0 says to clone QA templates first. There is no `cloneFromQuickAccess()` helper — the builder has to figure out the cloning pattern on its own.

### WARN: Shared Shell rule has undocumented exceptions

**page-patterns.md** Shared Shell:
> Content placeholder → 32px padding all sides, gray fill `#F5F5F5`

**page-patterns.md** Pattern 7 (HUB):
> Content placeholder: no padding, no fill — Card Row handles padding

The Shared Shell rule is wrong for HUB and GRID patterns. The exceptions aren't documented in the Shared Shell section — a builder following Shared Shell rules for a HUB page would produce an incorrect result.

### WARN: SKILL.md Step 0 omits LIST-NESTED

Step 0 pattern matching logic lists 7 layout types but does not include LIST-NESTED. A builder encountering a nested template page has no mapping in the selection logic.

---

## T3: Pattern Completeness

| Pattern | page-patterns.md | code-patterns.md recipe | Helpers exist | Result |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| LIST-SIMPLE | Pattern 2a | Full recipe | All | PASS |
| LIST-TAB | Pattern 2b | Full recipe | All | PASS |
| LIST-FULL | Pattern 2c | Full recipe | All | PASS |
| FORM | Pattern 1 | Full recipe | All | PASS |
| SLIDEIN | Pattern 4 (4a-4e) | Reference only ("use QA templates") | No build code | **WARN** |
| HUB | Pattern 7 | Full inline recipe | Inline (not in preamble) | PASS |
| DASH | Pattern 5 | Partial recipe (clonePanel only) | Missing: date filter bar, sub-tabs | **WARN** |
| DETAIL | Pattern 3 | No recipe | Blocked — 6 missing components | **FAIL** |
| GRID | Pattern 6 | No recipe | None | **FAIL** |
| LIST-NESTED | Pattern 8 | No recipe | None — clone source also deleted | **FAIL** |

**3 patterns have NO code recipe at all.** DETAIL is blocked by missing Figma components. GRID is documented in page-patterns.md but has no implementation. LIST-NESTED had a clone source (`180:69323`) which has been deleted.

---

## T4: Build Engine Correctness

### CRITICAL BUG: `setShell()` gets wrong Search variant

**Location:** code-patterns.md → Helper Library → `setShell()` → search branch

```javascript
const sv = _input.children.find(v =>
  v.name.includes('Type=Search') && v.name.includes('default-empty')
);
```

**Expected:** `Type=Search, State=default-empty` (index 30)
**Actual:** `Type=Search Button, State=default-empty` (index 27)

The `includes('Type=Search')` matcher is ambiguous — it matches both `Type=Search` and `Type=Search Button`. Since `Search Button` appears earlier in the component set's children array (index 27 vs 30), `find()` returns the **wrong variant**.

**Impact:** Every page built with `search: true` in setShell() renders a Search Button instead of a Search input. These are different components visually.

**Fix:**
```javascript
const sv = _input.children.find(v =>
  v.name.includes('Type=Search,') && v.name.includes('default-empty')
);
```
Adding the comma after `Search` excludes `Search Button`.

### WARN: `buildTable()` / `buildDataRow()` only automates text columns

The Quick Reference describes `buildTable()` as:
> Build complete table

But `buildDataRow()` only sets text content for types `['text','texticon','texttrailing','number']`. All other cell types (`icon`, `tag`, `status`, `checkbox`, `image`, `flags`, `action`, `ellipsis`) create the correct variant instance but **leave content blank**. Post-processing is required but not documented.

A builder calling `buildTable()` with tag or status columns will get empty cells with correct zebra striping but no visible content.

**Recommendation:** Either expand `buildDataRow()` to handle common non-text types, or add a clear note in the Quick Reference that non-text columns need manual content setting after `buildTable()`.

### All other helpers: PASS

| Helper | Result | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `init()` | PASS | All fonts, components, ROW map resolve correctly |
| `bootstrapScreen()` | PASS | Base Template structure matches exactly (Frame 1317 → Panel → Panel Header → content placeholder) |
| `buildHeaderRow()` | PASS | Creates instances, sets heading text, hides sort icons |
| `addPagination()` | PASS | Gets correct `Type=go to page` variant (substring matching is specific enough) |
| `addTabs()` | PASS | Finds `tab title and alert circle` → `text goes here` → sets text correctly |
| `addToolbar()` | PASS | Exact-match variant name (`===`) lookup is correct and unambiguous |
| `clonePanel()` | PASS | Functionally correct (creates/destroys temp screen to extract panel) |
| `cell()` | PASS | All 30 ROW map keys resolve to valid variants |
| `setText()` | PASS | Relies on init() font loading — correct |
| `setIcon()` | PASS | Finds v7-icon → icon text node |
| `bindFill()` / `bindStroke()` | PASS | All 33 variable IDs validated |
| `reattach()` | PASS | Uses getNodeByIdAsync correctly |

---

## T5: Rule Conflict Detection

### Feedback memories vs base instructions

| Check | Result | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| 26 feedback memories vs each other | PASS | No direct contradictions between feedback files |
| `feedback_use_figma_variables` vs `ZEBRA_GRAY` | **CONFLICT** | Code hardcodes `{r:0.9804,...}` instead of `bindFill(V.mono100)` |
| `feedback_clone_from_references` vs code recipes | **GAP** | All recipes use `bootstrapScreen()`, no clone helper exists |
| `feedback_qa_no_header_search_button` vs `bootstrapScreen()` | **GAP** | Memory notes "not all pages have headers" but no option to skip header in bootstrap |
| `feedback_panel_and_form_rules` "toolbar no fill" vs `addToolbar()` white fill | MINOR | Visually equivalent (`#FFFFFF` vs transparent on white bg) but technically different. Not a build-breaking issue. |
| Tag Leading Icon default contradiction | **CONFLICT** | component-ids.md says both `false` (line ~128) and `true` (line ~336). Actual: `true`. |

### Priority hierarchy clarity

The system defines a clear priority: **Rules > Observations > Guesses**. This is documented in both `feedback_rules_over_observation.md` and `feedback_extrapolate_not_mimic.md`. No conflicts found in the hierarchy itself.

## T6: Figma Live Validation

### Component IDs: 22/22 PASS

Every component ID in `component-ids.md` resolves to a valid node with the correct type and name.

| Component | ID | Type | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base Template | `94:21370` | COMPONENT | PASS |
| Input Fields | `91:6537` | COMPONENT_SET (32 variants) | PASS |
| button-btn | `91:8299` | COMPONENT_SET (40 variants) | PASS |
| Toggle | `91:8647` | COMPONENT_SET (10 variants) | PASS |
| Tag | `91:10023` | COMPONENT_SET (42 variants) | PASS |
| alert | `92:40484` | COMPONENT_SET (7 variants) | PASS |
| Header (table) | `91:39176` | COMPONENT | PASS |
| Row (table cell) | `91:39179` | COMPONENT_SET (30 variants) | PASS |
| tab | `91:19098` | COMPONENT_SET (20 variants) | PASS |
| Pagination | `92:40394` | COMPONENT_SET (6 variants) | PASS |
| Flag | `97:71963` | COMPONENT_SET (261 variants) | PASS |
| Breadcrumb Nav/1 | `134:84755` | COMPONENT | PASS |
| Breadcrumb Nav/2 | `94:21125` | COMPONENT | PASS |
| Block Selector | `91:8712` | COMPONENT_SET (6 variants) | PASS |
| Checkbox | `91:8542` | COMPONENT_SET (5 variants) | PASS |
| Radio | `91:8595` | COMPONENT_SET (5 variants) | PASS |
| Placeholder | `92:49611` | COMPONENT_SET (6 variants) | PASS |
| Date picker | `91:7183` | COMPONENT_SET (4 variants) | PASS |
| Overlay blur-small | `92:55554` | COMPONENT | PASS |
| Lifecycle card | `92:46699` | COMPONENT_SET (8 variants) | PASS |
| Action block | `92:55559` | COMPONENT_SET (14 variants) | PASS |
| Actions Panel | `92:56107` | COMPONENT_SET (4 variants) | PASS |

### Variable IDs: 33/33 PASS

Every variable ID in the `V` object and `component-ids.md` color table resolves correctly. Names and resolved types all match documentation.

### Quick Access Templates: 11/13

| Template | ID | Status | Page |
|---|---|---|---|
| Empty shell (base) | `92:54630` | PASS | Quick Access |
| LIST-FULL (All Activities) | `92:55380` | PASS | Quick Access |
| LIST-TAB (Lifecycles) | `181:72894` | PASS (FRAME, not INSTANCE) | Quick Access |
| SLIDEIN (SDT) | `92:56151` | PASS | Quick Access |
| SLIDEIN (Recurring) | `92:56159` | PASS | Quick Access |
| Slide-in LVL 1 shell | `92:54631` | PASS | Quick Access |
| Slide-in LVL 2 shell | `92:55549` | PASS | Quick Access |
| Activity Builder SDT | `92:54684` | PASS | Quick Access |
| Activity Builder Recurring | `92:55332` | PASS | Quick Access |
| Overlay blur-small | `92:55554` | PASS | Quick Access |
| Overlay blur-full | `92:55556` | PASS | Quick Access |
| **LIST-NESTED (Email Templates)** | `180:69323` | **FAIL — DELETED** | N/A |
| **Seed instance (CLAUDE.md)** | `3:5535` | **FAIL — DELETED** | N/A |

**Note:** `181:72894` (Lifecycles) is a FRAME, not an INSTANCE. All other QA templates are INSTANCEs. This means cloning Lifecycles via `detachInstance()` won't work — it would need `clone()` instead. Not a current bug (since no code references it for detaching) but worth noting.

### Row Variants: 30/30 PASS

All 15 cell types × 2 positions (EVEN/ODD) exist. The typeMap in `init()` produces correct lookup keys for all variants.

### Structural Validation: PASS

- Base Template: `side menu` + `Page Header` + `Frame 1317` → `Standard Panel` → `Panel Header` + `content placeholder`
- Header (table): `Heading` (TEXT) + `v7-icon` (INSTANCE) → `icon` (TEXT)
- Tab: `content` → `tab title and alert circle` → `text goes here` (TEXT) + `alert circle` | `Badge`
- Panel Header: `Title` (TEXT) + `Sub-Title` (TEXT) + `Search + Action Icons` (hidden by default) → `Input Fields` + `Toggle` + `Action icons`
- Page Header: `Left - Breadcrumb Navigation/2` + `Frame 1505` (3 children — icon button area)

All structural assumptions in the helper functions are confirmed against the live file.

---

## Recommended Fixes (Priority Order)

### P0 — Fix immediately (causes incorrect output)

**1. Fix `setShell()` Search variant lookup**
```javascript
// BEFORE (buggy):
const sv = _input.children.find(v => v.name.includes('Type=Search') && v.name.includes('default-empty'));

// AFTER (fixed):
const sv = _input.children.find(v => v.name.includes('Type=Search,') && v.name.includes('default-empty'));
```
One character (`,`) fixes the ambiguity.

**2. Remove deleted node references**
- `180:69323` (LIST-NESTED clone source) — remove from code-patterns.md Quick Access table
- `3:5535` (Seed instance) — remove from CLAUDE.md Key Decisions table

### P1 — Fix soon (documentation errors that mislead)

**3. Fix Tag Leading Icon default in component-ids.md**
Change line ~128 from `false` to `true` to match the live component and the Component Property Registry section.

**4. Remove `Search#4635:14` from page-patterns.md**
Replace the property reference in Pattern 2a and 2c with a note that search is enabled via `setShell({ search: true })` which toggles the `Search + Action Icons` frame visibility.

**5. Fix ZEBRA_GRAY to use variable binding**
```javascript
// BEFORE:
wrapper.fills = (index % 2 === 0) ? [] : [ZEBRA_GRAY];

// AFTER:
if (index % 2 !== 0) await bindFill(wrapper, V.mono100);
else wrapper.fills = [];
```

**6. Remove `references/design-system.md` reference from CLAUDE.md**
The file doesn't exist. Update the status table to remove the "design-system.md refreshed" claim.

### P2 — Address when convenient (gaps)

**7. Add cloneFromQuickAccess() helper** or document the clone pattern explicitly, since Gate 0 tells builders to clone but provides no code.

**8. Document buildTable() limitation** — add a note that non-text cell types (tag, status, icon, flags, image, action) need manual content setting after buildTable().

**9. Add exceptions to Shared Shell rule** — note in page-patterns.md that HUB and GRID patterns override the default content placeholder padding/fill.

**10. Update composition-tracker.md** pattern coverage — mark addToolbar and clonePanel as existing.

**11. Add LIST-NESTED to SKILL.md Step 0** pattern selection logic.

## What's Working Well

- **Component library is stable** — all 22 component IDs, 30 row variants, and 33 variable IDs are valid and correctly documented
- **Helper library architecture** — `init()` + `Promise.all` caching pattern is proven and efficient
- **Base Template structure** — exactly matches code expectations, no drift
- **Feedback memory system** — 26 rules are internally consistent and complement the base instructions
- **Brief template** — well-structured, covers all pattern types, includes construction notes and clone source fields
- **4 core patterns fully operational** — LIST-SIMPLE, LIST-TAB, LIST-FULL, FORM have complete recipes with proven builds
